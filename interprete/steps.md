# Steps
Model: Ensemble model 2 (Ensemble model with trainable FIN weights)

## Utterance level
1. Predict utterancel level features
2. T-sne and plot U-features in 2-d plane (altogether, and by each dataset)

## Frame level
1. Predict frame-utterance feature(correctness) / file prediction(correctness)
2. T-sne and draw scatterplot
3. Frame embedded plot

## k-means
1. frame prediction
2. Find the elbow
3. k-means clustering
